abstract: "We give a new characterization of Sobolev-Slobodeckij spaces $W^{1+s,p}(\\Omega)$ for $p>n$ and $\\frac{n}{p}<s<1$, where $n$ is the dimension of domain $\\Omega$. To achieve this we introduce a family of geometric curvature energies -- functionals on the space of surfaces inspired by the classical concept of integral Menger curvature. We prove that a function belongs to a Sobolev-Slobodeckij space if and only if it is Lipschitz continuous and its graph has finite geometric curvature energy of appropriate type."
