abstract: "A Radon measure $\\mu$ is $n$-rectifiable if it is absolutely continuous with respect to $\\mathcal{H}^n$ and $\\mu$-almost all of supp$\\mu$ can be covered by Lipschitz images of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. In this paper we give two sufficient conditions for rectifiability, both in terms of square functions of flatness-quantifying coefficients. The first condition involves the so-called $\\alpha$ and $\\beta_2$ numbers. The second one involves $\\alpha_2$ numbers -- coefficients quantifying flatness via Wasserstein distance $W_2$. Both conditions are necessary for rectifiability, too -- the first one was shown to be necessary by Tolsa, while the necessity of the $\\alpha_2$ condition is established in our recent paper. Thus, we get two new characterizations of rectifiability."
