abstract: "A Radon measure $\\mu$ is $n$-rectifiable if it is absolutely continuous with respect to $n$-dimensional Hausdorff measure and $\\mu$-almost all of supp$\\mu$ can be covered by Lipschitz images of $\\mathbb{R}^n$⁠. In this paper, we give a necessary condition for rectifiability in terms of the so-called $\\alpha_2$ numbers — coefficients quantifying flatness using Wasserstein distance $W_2$⁠. In a recent article, we showed that the same condition is also sufficient for rectifiability, and so we get a new characterization of rectifiable measures."
