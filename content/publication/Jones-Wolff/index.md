abstract: "In this work we obtain a geometric characterization of the measures $\\mu$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with polynomial upper growth of degree $n$ such that the $n$-dimensional Riesz transform $\\mathcal{R}\\mu (x) = \\int \\frac{x-y}{|x-y|^{n+1}}d\\mu(y)$ belongs to $L^2(\\mu)$, under the assumption that $\\mu$ satisfies the following Wolff energy estimate, for any ball $B\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$: $$\\int_B \\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac{\\mu(B(x,r))}{r^{n-\\frac38}}\\right)^2\\frac{dr}r d\\mu(x)\\leq M\\bigg(\\frac{\\mu(2B)}{r(B)^{n-\\frac38}}\\bigg)^2\\mu(2B).$$ More precisely, we show that $\\mu$ satisfies the following estimate: $$\\|\\mathcal{R}\\mu\\|_{L^2(\\mu)}^2 + \\|\\mu\\|\\approx \\int\\int_0^\\infty \\beta_{\\mu,2}(x,r)^2\\frac{\\mu(B(x,r))}{r^n}\\frac{dr}r d\\mu(x) + \\|\\mu\\|,$$ where $\\beta_{\\mu,2}(x,r)^2 = \\inf_L \\frac1{r^n}\\int_{B(x,r)} \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{dist}(y,L)}r\\right)^2d\\mu(y),$ with the infimum taken over all affine $n$-planes $L\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In a companion paper which relies on the results obtained in this work it is shown that the same result holds without the above assumption regarding the Wolff energy of $\\mu$. This result has important consequences for the Painlev\\'e problem for Lipschitz harmonic functions."
