abstract: "Favard length of a set is the average length of its orthogonal projections.
The Besicovitch projection theorem states the following: for any set E of finite length
whose Favard length is positive there exists a rectifiable curve intersecting E in a set of
positive length. The Favard length problem consists of quantifying this theorem, which
is crucial for understanding the relation between Favard length and analytic capacity. In
this talk I will discuss recent resolution to the Favard length problem for Ahlfors regular
sets."
