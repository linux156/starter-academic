summary: ""
abstract: "Besicovitch projection theorem is one of the fundamental
results of geometric measure theory, and it states that a set of finite
length is purely unrectifiable (i.e., its intersection with every
rectifiable curve has length 0) if and only if almost every orthogonal
projection of this set has length 0. In this talk I will present recent
attempts at quantifying this result."
