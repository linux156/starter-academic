summary: ""
abstract: "We say that a compact set $E\subset\textbf{C}$ is removable for bounded analytic functions if for any open set $U\supset E$ all bounded analytic functions $f:U\setminus E\to\textbf{C}$ admit an analytic extension to $U$. In the 60s Vitushkin conjectured that a set is removable if and only if it has negligible projections (i.e., almost every projection of $E$ has zero length). In the case of sets with $\sigma$-finite length Vitushkin's conjecture has been shown to be true by G. David in 1998. On the other hand, the conjecture fails for $1$-dimensional sets with non-$\sigma$-finite length: in 1988 P. Jones and T. Murai constructed a set with negligible projections which is non-removable for bounded analytic functions. In other words, one of the implications comprising Vitushkin's conjecture is false. It is still unknown whether the other implication is true. Suppose that $E$ has non-negligible projections; does this imply that $E$ is non-removable for bounded analytic functions? In this talk I am going to describe recent progress made on this question: if $E$ has plenty of big projections, then $E$ is non-removable for bounded analytic functions. Based on ongoing work with Michele Villa."
