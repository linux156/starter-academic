summary: ""
abstract: "The visibility conjecture states that if $E$ is a planar set with Hausdorff dimension $dim(E) > 1$,
then for almost every direction the “visible part of $E$” (the subset of E that we “see” looking from
that direction) has dimension 1. This conjecture is wide open even for self-similar sets with nice
separation conditions. I will talk about a recent result where I showed that for Ahlfors regular sets
dimension drop occurs for their visible parts."
