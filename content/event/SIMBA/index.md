summary: ""
abstract: "In this talk we will look at the following question: given a subset of the plane, what is the relation between the size of the set and the size of its orthogonal projections? To make the notion of “size” more precise, I will first explain what the Hausdorff measures and the Hausdorff dimension are. The talk should be accessible to anyone who has completed a basic calculus course."
