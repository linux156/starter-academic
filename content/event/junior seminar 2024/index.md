abstract: "This talk will be a gentle introduction to the classical Buffon's needle problem, which can be stated as follows: can you measure length of a set by randomly tossing a needle on top of it? Time permitting, we will also discuss some modern incarnations of this question. The talk may involve throwing pens around the room, proceed with caution."
