## Course description

The course will focus on singular integral operators (SIOs), which are operators of the form $Tf(x) = \\int K(x,y) f(y) dy$, where the kernel $K(x,y)$ has a singularity on the diagonal $x=y$. The basic question we will study is: under what hypothesis on the kernel $K$ is the operator $T$ bounded on $L^p$? We will cover a mix of classical results and more recent advances. Specific topics may include:
- classical examples (Hilbert transform, Riesz transform, Cauchy transform) and how they naturally appear in PDEs and complex analysis
- dyadic cubes and why they are useful
- general singular integral operators and the Calderón-Zygmund decomposition
- the Littlewood-Paley theory
- the Cauchy transform on Lipschitz graphs
- SIOs in the weighted setting, the Muckenhoupt $A_p$ weights
- sparse domination and the $A_2$ theorem of Hytönen

## Prerequisites

Coming soon.

## Passing the course

The students are expected to solve problems for the weekly exercise sessions. At the end of the course each student will make a presentation on a chosen topic related to the course. Possible topics of presentations will be posted here at some point.

## Exercise lists

The exercise lists will be posted here weekly.
